### Description

Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that exexutes commands read from the standard input or from a file. 	Bash also incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells(ksh and csh).

Bash is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1).	 Bash can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.

### Options

All of the single-character shell options documented in the description of the set builtin command can be used as options when the shell is invoked. 	In addition, bash interprets the following options when it is invoked:

- -c	`string`	If the -c option is present, then commands are read from `string`. 	If there are arguments after the `string`, they are assigned to positional parameters, **starting** with $0.
- -i      如果有-i选项, shell 将交互地执行.
- -l      选项使得bash以类似登录shell的方式启动
- -r     如果有-r选项,shell成为受限的.
